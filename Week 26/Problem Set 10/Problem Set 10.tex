    \section{Topic E Problem 23}
        What are the possible values of m$_\ell$ and m$_s$ for a 4f electron?
        
        \subsection{Solution}
            The value of $\ell$ is 3.
            This means that the values of m$_\ell$ are \boxed{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}.\\
            The electron can have either positive or negative spin, so the possible values of m$_s$ are \boxed{+\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}}.

    \section{Topic E Problem 24}
        Explain why it is impossible for an orbital to have n = 3 and $\ell$ = 3. 
        (Hint: think about what these numbers are telling you about nodes.)

        \subsection{Solution}
            The value of n is 0 and it is 1 more than the number of nodes.
            $\ell$ describes the number of angular nodes.
            If the value of n is 3, there are $n - 1 = 2$ total nodes.
            If the value of $\ell$ is 3, there are 3 angular nodes.
            The prior two statements contradict each other.
