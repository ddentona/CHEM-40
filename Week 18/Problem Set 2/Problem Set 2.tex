    \section{Topic A Problem 12}
        What mass of \ce{Fe2O3} would react with 20.00 g of \ce{Zn}? 
        The chemical equation for this reaction is: 
        \begin{equation}
            \ce{3Zn + Fe2O3 -> 2Fe + 3ZnO}
        \end{equation}

        \subsection{Solution}
            The simple stoichiometry is the way to go here.
            \begin{equation}
                20.00 \unit{\gram} \times \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{Zn}}{65.38 \unit{\gram}} \times \frac{1\,\ce{Fe2O3}}{3\,\ce{Zn}} \times \frac{159.7\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{Fe2O3}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{Fe2O3}}  =   \boxed{16.28\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{Fe2O3}}
            \end{equation}

    \section{Topic A Problem 13}
        x moles of \ce{C4H10} reacts with oxygen according to the following equation: 
        \begin{equation}
            \ce{2C4H10 + 13O2 -> 8CO2 + 10H2O}
        \end{equation}
        a) How many moles of water are formed?\\
        b) How many moles of oxygen are consumed?

        \subsection{Solution (a)}
            The ratio of \ce{C4H10} used to \ce{H2O} created in this reaction is 1:5.
            With x moles of \ce{C4H10}, that would gives us \boxed{5x\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{H2O}}.

        \subsection{Solution (b)}
            The ratio of \ce{C4H10} used to \ce{O2} consumed in this reaction is 2:13.
            With x moles of \ce{C4H10}, that would gives us \boxed{\frac{13}{2}x\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{O2}}.

    \section{Topic A Problem 14}
        10.00 g of \ce{N2} is mixed with 33.61 g of \ce{F2}, and the elements react according to the following equation: 
        \begin{equation}
            \ce{N2 + 3F2 -> 2NF3}
        \end{equation}
        a) Which element is the limiting reactant?\\
        b) What is the theoretical yield of \ce{NF3}?\\
        c) If the reaction goes to completion, how many grams of the excess reactant will remain?\\
        d) Set up an ICE table for this reaction.

        \subsection{Solution (a)}
            First, we calculate the theoretical yields for each for the reactants.
            \begin{align}
                m_{\ce{N2}} &=  10.00\,\unit{\gram} \times \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{N2}}{28.02\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{N2}} 
                                                    \times \frac{2\,\ce{NF3}}{1\,\ce{N2}}
                                                    \times \frac{71.01\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{NF3}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{NF3}}
                    =   50.69\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{NF3}
                \\
                m_{\ce{F2}} &=  33.61\,\unit{\gram} \times \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{F2}}{38.00\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{F2}} 
                                                    \times \frac{2\,\ce{NF3}}{3\,\ce{F2}}
                                                    \times \frac{71.01\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{NF3}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{NF3}}
                    =   41.87\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{NF3}
            \end{align}

            With a lower final mass, \boxed{\ce{F2}} is the limiting reactant.

        \subsection{Solution (b)}
            The theoretical yield was found in part (a).
            \boxed{41.87\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{NF3}}
        
        \subsection{Solution (c)}
            Use a similar strategy to part (a).
            \begin{equation}
                33.61\,\unit{\gram} \times \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{F2}}{38.00\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{F2}} 
                                    \times \frac{1\,\ce{N2}}{3\,\ce{F2}}
                                    \times \frac{28.02\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{N2}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{N2}}
                    =   8.261\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{NF3}
            \end{equation}

            Subtract this from the available mass of \ce{N2} to get the final \ce{N2}.
            \begin{equation}
                10.00\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{N2} - 8.261\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{N2}    =   \boxed{1.74\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{N2}}
            \end{equation}
        
        \subsection{Solution (d)}
            I used tabular for this table.
            Please excuse any poor or improper formatting.

            \begin{center}
                \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
                    \hline
                    \unit{\mole} & \ce{N2} &\ce{+ 3F2} &\ce{-> 2NF3} \\
                    \hline 
                    I   & 0.3569    &0.8844     &0\\
                    \hline
                    C   & -0.2948   &-0.8844    &0.5896\\
                    \hline
                    E   & 0.0621    &0          &0.5896\\ \hline
                \end{tabular}
            \end{center}

            For those interested in how I went about getting these values, I can explain.
            I started with the initial mass of \ce{F2}, which has been previously established to be the limiting reactant, and converted that to moles.
            I did (roughly) the same thing for the known quantity of \ce{N2} initially.
            We also start with no \ce{NF3}.
            Assuming the percentage yield to be 100\%, every mole of \ce{F2} would be used, so the Change row for \ce{F2} would be the negative of the initial quantity of \ce{F2}.
            Multiply that by the ratio of \ce{N2} to \ce{F2} ($\frac{1}{3}$) to get the Change row of \ce{N2}.
            The same can be done for \ce{NF2}, just taking the negative thereof and with a ratio of $\frac{2}{3}$ instead of $\frac{1}{3}$.
            With all of this, we only have to add the initial and the change together (respecting the positive or negative signs) to get the values for the End row.

    \section{Topic A Problem 15}
        a) If 58.26 g of iodine reacts with excess aluminum, what is the theoretical yield of aluminum iodide? 
        The reaction is \ce{2 Al + 3 I2 -> 2 AlI3}.\\
        b) If 56.11 g of aluminum iodide is actually formed in the reaction in part a, what is the percent yield of aluminum iodide?

        \subsection{Solution (a)}
            Watch me use the power of Stiochiometry Magic.
            \begin{equation}
                58.26\,\unit{\gram} \times  \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{I2}}{253.8\,\unit{\gram}\,\unit{I2}}
                                    \times  \frac{2\,\ce{AlI3}}{3\,\ce{I2}}
                                    \times  \frac{407.68\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{AlI3}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{AlI3}}
                    =   \boxed{62.39\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{AlI3}}
            \end{equation}
        
        \subsection{Solution (b)}
            Here we use the formula for the pecent yield.
            \begin{equation}
                \text{PY}   =   \frac{\rm AY}{\rm TY}   \times  100\%
                    =   \frac{56.11\,\unit{\gram}}{62.39\,\unit{\gram}} \times  100\%
                    =   0.8994 \times 100\%
                    =   \boxed{89.94\%}
            \end{equation}

    \section{Topic A Problem 16}
        A chemist mixes 16.00 g of \ce{HCl} with 10.00 g of \ce{Mg} and obtains an 81.3\% yield of \ce{MgCl2}.
        What mass of \ce{MgCl2} did the chemist obtain? 
        The chemical reaction is:
        \begin{equation}
            \ce{Mg + 2 HCl -> MgCl2 + H2}
        \end{equation}

        \subsection{Solution}
            First calculate the theoretical yield of \ce{MgCl2} in the cases of \ce{HCl} and \ce{Mg} being the limiting reactants.
            \begin{align}
                MM(\ce{MgCl2})  &=  24.31\,\unit{\gram/\mole} + 2 * 35.45\,\unit{\gram/\mole}
                    =   95.21\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\\
                MM(\ce{HCl})    &=  1.008\,\unit{\gram/\mole} + 35.45\,\unit{\gram/\mole}
                    =   36.458\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\\
                m_{\ce{Mg}}     &=  10.00\,\unit{\gram} \times  \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{Mg}}{24.31\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{Mg}}
                                                        \times  \frac{1\,\ce{MgCl2}}{1\,\ce{Mg}}
                                                        \times  \frac{95.21\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{MgCl2}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{MgCl2}}\\
                                &=  39.16\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{MgCl2}
                \\
                m_{\ce{HCl}}    &=  16.00\,\unit{\gram} \times  \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{HCl}}{36.458\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{HCl}}
                                                        \times  \frac{1\,\ce{MgCl2}}{2\,\ce{HCl}}
                                                        \times  \frac{95.21\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{MgCl2}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{MgCl2}}\\
                                &=  20.89\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{MgCl2}
            \end{align}

            The latter is lower, so the \ce{HCl} would be the limiting reactant and $20.89\,\unit{\gram}$ $\,\ce{MgCl2}$ would be the theoretical yield.
            Multiplying this by the (decimal version of) the percetage yield to get the actual yield.
            \begin{gather}
                20.89\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{MgCl2} * 0.813 = \boxed{17.0\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{MgCl2}}
            \end{gather}

        How many milliliters of liquid \ce{Br2} (density = 3.1 g/mL) will react with 6.143 g of \ce{Cr}, if the product of this reaction is \ce{CrBr3}?

        \subsection{Solution}
            First write a chemical equation for this and balance it.
            \begin{center}
                \ce{3Br2 + 2Cr -> 2CrBr3}
            \end{center}

            The rest of the path is paved with the magic of Stoichiometry.
            \begin{equation}
                6.143\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{Cr}    \times  \frac{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{Cr}}{52.00\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{Cr}}
                                                \times  \frac{3\,\ce{Br2}}{2\,\ce{Cr}}
                                                \times  \frac{159.8\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{Br2}}{1\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{Br2}}
                                                \times  \frac{1\,\unit{\milli\liter}}{3.1\,\unit{\gram}}
                    =   \boxed{9.1\,\unit{\milli\liter}\,\ce{Br2}}

            \textbf{Calculations}

            Convert grams to moles for oxygen and ethane.
            \begin{align}
                n(\ce{O2})  &=  \frac{m}{MM}
                    =   \frac{194.60\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{O2}}{32.00\,\unit{\gram/\mole}}
                    =   6.08125\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{O2}\\
                n(\ce{C2H6})    &=  \frac{m}{MM}
                    =   \frac{81.43\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{C2H6}}{30.068\,\unit{\gram/\mole}}
                    =   2.708194759\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{C2H6}
            \end{align}

            Next, we check which would result in the most product, for the coefficient $c$ of each reactant.
            \begin{align}
                ML  &=  \frac{n}{c}\\
                ML(\ce{O2})     &=  \frac{6.08125\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{O2}}{7\,\ce{O2}}
                    =   0.86875\,\unit{\mole}\\
                ML(\ce{C2H6})   &=  \frac{2.708194759\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{C2H6}}{2\,\ce{C2H6}}
                    =   1.357\,\unit{\mole}
            \end{align}

            This makes the \ce{O2} the limiting reactant.
            We can just fill out the ICE table's `C' (change) values from here by using ratios of coefficients of reactants and products.
            I won't go write all my calculations here, but they tend to have a simple formula.
            \begin{equation}
                n_2 =   n_1 * \frac{c_2}{c_1}
            \end{equation}

            This leads into the filling out of the bottom row (end), with a simple formula, E = I + C.
            From here, all we need to do is convert moles to grams.
            \begin{align}
                MM(\ce{C2H6})   &=  2 * 12.01\,\unit{\gram/\mole} + 6 * 1.008\,\unit{\gram/\mole}
                    =   30.068\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\\
                MM(\ce{O2})     &=  2 * 16.00\,\unit{\gram/\mole}
                    =   32.00\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\\
                MM(\ce{CO2})    &=  12.01 + 2 * 16.00\,\unit{\gram/\mole}
                    =   44.01\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\\
                MM(\ce{H2O})    &=  2 * 1.008\,\unit{\gram/\mole} + 16.00\,\unit{\gram/\mole}
                    =   18.016\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\\
                m   &=  MM * n\\
                m(\ce{C2H6})    &=  30.068\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\,\ce{C2H6} * 0.971\,\unit{\mole}
                    =   \boxed{29.20\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{C2H6}}\\
                m(\ce{O2})      &=  32.00\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\,\ce{O2} * 0\,\unit{\mole}
                    =   \boxed{0\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{O2}}\\
                m(\ce{CO2})     &=  44.01\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\,\ce{CO2} * 3.475\,\unit{\mole}
                    =   \boxed{152.9\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{CO2}}\\
                m(\ce{H2O})     &=  18.016\,\unit{\gram/\mole}\,\ce{H2O} * 5.212\,\unit{\mole}
                    =   \boxed{93.90\,\unit{\gram}\,\ce{H2O}}
            \end{align}

        \subsection{Solution (c)}
            We'll just put together an ICE table and fill it out until we have enough information to get the answer.
            We don't even need to fill it out completely.
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tabular}{| c | c |c| c |c| c |c| c |}
                    \hline
                    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\unit{\mole}}  &   \multicolumn{1}{c}{\ce{2 C2H6}} &\multicolumn{1}{c}{+}& \multicolumn{1}{c}{\ce{7 O2}}   &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\ce{->}}&   \multicolumn{1}{c}{\ce{4 CO2}}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{+}& \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\ce{6 H2O}}
                    \\  \hline
                    I   &   0.502   &&  3.414   &&  0       &&  0
                    \\  \hline
                    C   &   -0.502  &&  -1.757  &&          &&  
                    \\  \hline
                    E   &   0       &&  1.657   &&          &&  
                    \\  \hline
                \end{tabular}
            \end{center}

            I have a few steps I made for this.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item   We can start by filling out our knowns. 
                In the interest of candor, we don't even know if the initial amount of \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O} is 0, that's just an assumption I made.
                \item   Since the \ce{O2} has some left over at the end, it is definitely not the limiting reactant.
                That makes \ce{C2H6} the limiting reactant, so none of it should be left by the end and we can fill that out.
                \item   The formula of C = E - I can be applied for Oxygen, giving us our change in \ce{O2}.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item   If you ever took Physics or Calculus (maybe even Algebra), you'll recognize this as equivalent to $\Delta x = x_f - x_i$. 
                \end{itemize}
                \item   We can use the coefficient ratio mentioned in part (b), this time $\frac{2}{7}$, for the change in \ce{C2H6}.
                \item   The formula C = E - I can be turned into I = E - C to get initial quantity of \ce{C2H6}.
            \end{enumerate}

            With everything filled out, we have the final answer of \boxed{0.502\,\unit{\mole}\,\ce{C2H6}}.
